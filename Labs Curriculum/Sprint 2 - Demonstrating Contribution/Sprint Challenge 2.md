# Sprint Challenge: Sprint 2

## Objectives

- Student can articulate their delivery process in contributing to and completing individual tasks.
- Student can demonstrate, in detail, how their solution relates to the specification and architectural standards.
- Student can articulate the challenges and lessons learned from managing their time working on a complex project in a team.

## Prompt 1 - Communicating Individual Contribution

On the job, you will be responsible for shipping features regularly. Engineers are given tickets and are expected to deliver them. Hiring managers want to see that you are capable of delivering a feature.

Here are some examples of hiring manager interview questions:

- "Tell me about a project you've built."
- "What were some technical challenges on that project? How did you overcome them?"

We took these questions and cooked them into your labs experience. This week, you should have shipped at least one feature. Answer the following questions like you would in an interview:

### Questions you need to answer

1. Describe what you built this week. Link any relevant pull requests or paste screenshots of code.
   This week, I used a React library called Ant Design to implement the sidebar animation as well as an autocomplete feature while searching in the search bar. This auto-completion feature helped fully flesh out the functionality of the search bar. Please feel free to look at a recent Pull Request I submitted in Github that shows my work: 

https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Labs26-Citrics-FE-TeamB/pull/11

2. How does what you built contribute to the overall product your team is building? What user problems does it help solve?
   This contributes to the product because it is the heart of the purpose of the product and design. It is crucial for the user to have a functional search bar that pulls up suggestions to cities that are in our database; this will help prevent any searches that are not in our database. The search bar is the first connection to the in-depth process of our product. The overall design of the navigation bar to be able to slide in and out is also a key component that our team designed so that the user may always have access to the search bar, no matter what page they’re on.

3. Describe your delivery process for what you built this week from ideation to breakdown to implementation. What challenges occurred during the delivery process that you didn't foresee?
   I first listed what features needed to be done and broke them down into smaller steps. For instance, in order to create the functionality of the search bar, I needed to use form management to create the search bar, use state management and functions using useState to build out the functionality of the search bar, pull up results from the dummy data--which also needed to be created--and also have the autocompletion of the search bar implemented. After breaking down the steps and assigning tasks, I was able to have a clear knowledge of the specific features I needed to work on. Challenges that were unseen at the time were the autocomplete feature not working after changing the documentation to exactly suit our needs. Although I tried many methods to resolve this issue, the same error would pop up in different areas. It was confusing because the TypeError it was giving back was talking about an ‘in’ operator that hadn’t been coded. After debugging and pair programming, the error was able to be resolved because the dummy data itself that didn’t match with the outline that Ant Design had with theirs. So although I needed to change the file to implement the autocomplete, I also needed to look at how that data was being stored and searched. The implementation definitely took longer than expected, but it was able to be completed and merged in the deadline we had set.

## Prompt 2 - Communicating Teamwork

As a software developer, you will almost always be on a team. As a result, engineering hiring managers want to see how you work on a team. As a junior developer, you will often pair with seniors on features. Here are some examples of interview questions you may get asked concerning teamwork:

- "Tell me about a time you worked on a team. What was hard about it?"
- "What is your greatest weakness as a team player? How have you improved?"

This week we taught you how to pair with other team members. You should have worked with at least one other person to deliver a feature. Reflect on that experience and answer the following questions like you would in an interview:

### Questions you need to answer

1. How did you work with another team member to deliver a feature this week? What role did you play?
   My individual work collaborates with working with a team member this week because my teammate and I both worked on the search function. As I already stated, I build the sidebar animation and the autocomplete feature for our search bar. We pair programmed the first day as I implemented the sidebar and rendering while she worked on state management to get the functionality of the search bar going with the dummy data. We used a VSCode plugin feature called LiveShare so we could both be the ‘driver’ at the same time, and then we would take turns navigating on certain aspects.

2. What did you learn this week from working in a team? How are you going to improve your teamwork in the future?
   I learned that working on problems, features, and overall vision of the product with a team saves time if I were to do the product by myself. With active communication, our team was able to plan and implement a good amount of features this week and help one another with our own skills and experiences during setbacks. I want to improve my teamwork in the future by improving my own skills so that I can contribute more to my team. 

## Prompt 3 - Professional Development Resume Updates

This week you gained more clarity surrounding your individual contributions and what is happening with your project. Use this clarification, along with your understanding of power statements, to update the projects sections of your resume. When adding a project to your resume, you should include power statement bullets describing the project as if it were a job! Without these bullets you're simply sharing the name of a project (and maybe a tech stack) with little to no clarity on what you did on that project.

To ensure you are creating a robust and ready to use job search resume, use this [resume checklist](https://www.notion.so/lambdaschool/Resume-30f5e6add3324891823192487798cb6d) as a way to organize and add content. If you skipped the resume lesson earlier in the curriculum and are starting from scratch, you'll want to review [this assignment worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yAvlgwSPTdXxAbtx3mgfWp6dkNnqtzGGLlRy2yQ7fiA/edit) to establish a resume draft (though the resume checklist will help you establish a draft as well).

### To complete the career portion of this challenge:

1. Updated your resume to include your labs project, with power statements articulating your individual tasks.
2. Upload this resume version to CV compiler for feedback:

    1️⃣ Go to the website [https://cvcompiler.com/students/lambda](https://cvcompiler.com/students/lambda)

    2️⃣ Log in (using LinkedIn or GitHub) -> Fill out the form

    3️⃣ Enter the special promo code [LSalumni, ANDresumes, iOSresumes, DSresumes, WEBresumes, UXresumes] during checkout

    4️⃣ Upload your resume and start working on improving it with CV Compiler

3. After making the recommended CV Compiler edits, upload your resume to google drive and drop a link.

4. Update your LinkedIn to include any new content you made for your resume. The experience bullets you created for your resume and projects are great examples of content you should consider bringing over to your profile.

**Your submission for Prompt 3 should be a link to your resume**
