# Module Inquiry 3

## Questions

1. What feature did you work on with a teammate up to this point in the sprint?
    The feature we worked on is the slide-out navigation bar. This feature will also have a search form implemented to search for a city by name.
2. When were you the driver? When were you the navigator? Which role did you prefer and why?
    I was the driver when I was showing the error messages when trying to see the app on localhost. The team needed to navigate me in searching through files to find all Okta authorizations to comment it out of our code. I was the navigator when creating a ternary for selected cities. I liked being the driver because I like bouncing ideas off with a coworker and then implementing it myself so I solidify that knowledge/skill I was doing.
3. What was difficult about being a navigator?
    It was hard sometimes to follow along when the driver doesn’t talk a whole lot or if it’s a topic I’m not aware of. This was easily fixed by asking questions or when the driver would continue to explain things.
4. How will you adjust your pair programming behavior in the future?
    I definitely like using Live Stream on VSCode so that my pair programmer can switch off between driver and navigator or both individually become a driver and then ask each other questions when it comes up.
