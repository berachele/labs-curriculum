# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
    - Should there be search recommendations as you’re typing?
    - Do you want a ‘save city’ or ‘favorites’ feature for easy user access?
    - Does search have city only or do you want filters for specifics?
    - Additional features/implementations? (Education systems/schools nearby for yourself or if you have children)

2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
    - View the housing prices of a city
    - View the population of a city
    - Compare multiple cities side by side
    - View major job industries in a city
    - View weather data for a city
    - Search for a city by name
    - Search for a city by Zip code

3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?

    My favorite user story is that we can compare multiple cities side by side. We talked about how to implement the feature and it looks like it can be a lot of fun to have it show up. We need to gather the data of the city demographics, design a mechanism to select cities to be compared, design the comparison view and add information about selected cities to global state (so that it can be remembered when searching for other cities). 

	I was able to contribute ideas and what the priority features need to be implemented--we need to know what data we want to have and to have functionality first before any styling. I think some challenges I ran into was becoming more observant than voicing my opinion because so many were in discussion. However, I was still thinking of ideas of what we could add and affirmed what I thought when other team members had ideas.

4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?

    I think something that I would have liked to do after figuring out what product team I was on, was to go through the roadmap myself and write down user features that I could already think of so I could be more prepared. I was preparing by writing down any questions that came to mind, but I also wish I did more preparation so I could bring more to the table with my team.
