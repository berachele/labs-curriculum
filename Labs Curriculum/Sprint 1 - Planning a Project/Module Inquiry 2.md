# Module Inquiry 2

## Questions

1. What technical choices did you make today? 
    - Formatted Engineering Architecture model for app using Whimsical
    - Decided as a team to use Nodejs for backend
    - Using React Redux for frontend
    - Decided that we would not implement login system with authentication
    - Discussed pros and cons with having one GET query vs many

2. Pick two technical choices you're happy with. What was your thought process as you made those choices? What did you consider and what did you decide against?
    What is my experience with this specific skill? What is the experience of my team with this specific skill? What is the majority preference language to use?

    - Take a moment to think about the advantages in choosing the route that you did.
        Advantages of using Node is that it is something I am familiar with and
        that I have experience working with it. Don’t need to learn a new language

    - Now take a moment to consider the disadvantages.
        Would be stretching myself in some aspects, but not too much. I would 
        also not be learning Java or Spring so I don’t know what aspects Java brings that Node doesn’t have to offer.

3. In one or two sentences, summarize why you ultimately made the choice you did.
   As a team, we ultimately decided to use Node for backend because we would all be uniform in the app.
4. Extracting useful conclusions from your process: 
    - According to your understanding, what makes a good technical choice?
    
    A good technical voice would be understanding all your options and the functions or uses of that option. If you’re working in a team, you want to know the input of others and based on that input make that decision because it affects the product as a whole.
